## Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share my projects in both data science and software engineering. This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, software applications, and code that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development.

## Data Science Projects

1. **Emotion Classification Using Naive Bayes Classifier**
   - Description: In this data science project, I developed a Jupyter notebook for Emotion Classification using a Naive Bayes Classifier. I leveraged various Python libraries, including Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, to create an effective emotion classification model.

   - [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/freak360/emotion-dataset-nlp-sentiment-analysis/input)
   - 
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Dataset:** The project utilized the Emotion Dataset available on Kaggle, containing text data with associated emotions.
     - **Classification Model:** The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an F1 score of approximately 0.88.
     - **User Input Testing:** The notebook includes a section for user input, allowing testing with custom text inputs not in the dataset.

2. **Predicting Student Performance Using Linear Regression**
   - Description: This data science project focuses on predicting student performance using a Linear Regression model. The Jupyter notebook incorporates Python libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. The project showcases a highly accurate model with an R-Squared score of approximately 0.98.

  - [Dataset](https://github.com/jaysomp/Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Predicting%20student%20performance%20using%20Linear%20Regression/Student_Performance.csv)
    
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Dataset:** The project used a dataset available on the GitHub repository, containing student performance data.
     - **Linear Regression Model:** The model achieved an impressive R-Squared score of approximately 0.98.
     - **User Input Testing:** The notebook allows testing the model with custom data, making predictions on student performance not   present in the dataset.
